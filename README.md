## Hi ðŸŒ±ðŸŒ¿ðŸŒ»

I am a data analyst and visual artist with experience in projects for strategic decision-making. My conviction: information as a tool serving society to make this world a better place. I have a creative stamp thanks to my previous training and years of work in the arts and culture sector, where I have been able to develop collaborative and research projects, both independently and for cultural institutions.

Making data accessible and visualizable, combined with analytical skills, is my specialty. I work with tools such as Agile Scrum methodology, SQL, Python, BigQuery, Google Colab, Looker Studio, and PowerBI. I possess interpersonal skills like collaboration, respect, commitment, rigor, and adaptability to diverse environments. I am constantly seeking to learn, grow, and contribute, both personally and professionally. I am passionate about innovation, sustainability, and inclusion projects. I have been involved in volunteering and activism, which have shaped my commitment to social responsibility.

I currently live in Chile and am seeking new learning and work opportunities, whether remote, on-site, or hybrid.
